✅ Final Prompt (Copy-Paste Ready for AI Design Tools)

“Design a modern onboarding mobile screen with a dark purple gradient background. Place a ‘Skip’ button at the top-right with 16px medium white text and 20px padding. Center the app logo near the top, followed by a bold 24px white headline saying ‘Share your moments with reviews, photos, and videos’. Add a clean illustration centered below the text, sized around 240px width. Under the illustration, include four pagination dots, with the active dot in #A071FF and the inactive dots in semi-transparent white. At the bottom center, add a full-width rounded button (85% width, 56px height, 16px corner radius) with a purple background (#7A45E5) and white 18px semi-bold text labeled ‘Next’. Use balanced spacing, center alignment, and smooth vertical rhythm across the layout.”

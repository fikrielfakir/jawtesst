UX Design Prompt: "Restaurant Registration Form"
Objective: Design a clear, intuitive, and efficient multi-step form for restaurant owners to submit a registration request. The form must guide the user through providing essential business information with minimal friction.

Overall Aesthetic:

Style: Clean, Professional, and Form-Focused.

Mood: Trustworthy, straightforward, and professional.

Color Palette:

Background: Light Grey (#F9F9F9 or #FFFFFF).

Primary Color: A color that inspires trust and action (e.g., Forest Green #0A7A4B, Royal Blue #2563EB).

Text Color:

Headings/Labels: Near-Black (#1F2937).

Body/Placeholder: Dark Grey (#6B7280).

Border: Light Grey (#D1D5DB).

Typography: Use a highly legible sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, SF Pro Text).

Font Weight Strategy: Use font weights strategically to create a clear hierarchy (e.g., Semibold for labels, Regular for input text).

Detailed Layout & Specifications
1. Header Section
Position: Top of the scrollable content area.

Content:

Title: "Register Restaurant"

Text Size: 26pt (Bold)

Color: #1F2937 (Near-Black)

Alignment: Left-aligned.

Padding: 24pt from the top and sides.

2. Form Fields Section
Position: Below the header, in a scrollable container if necessary.

Layout: All form fields should be stacked vertically with consistent spacing.

General Field Structure:

Label: e.g., "Restaurant Name"

Text Size: 14pt (Semibold)

Color: #1F2937

Spacing: 8pt margin below the label.

Input Field Container:

Height: 50pt

Background: White (#FFFFFF)

Border: 1pt solid #D1D5DB

Corner Radius: 8pt

Padding: 0pt 12pt (horizontal padding for text).

Color: #9CA3AF (Medium Grey)

Input Text (User Typing):

Text Size: 16pt (Regular)

Color: #1F2937 (Near-Black)

Specific Field Behaviors:

"Type" Field ("Select Type"): This should be a dropdown selector. The placeholder "Select Type" should be in the medium grey placeholder color. Tapping it should open a modal or action sheet with options like "Fine Dining," "Casual," "Cafe," "Fast Food," etc.

"About your business" Field: This should be a multi-line text input.

Height: 100pt (to allow for multiple lines of text).

Divider Line ("---"):

Position: After the last form field ("About your business"), before the submit button.

Style: 1pt solid #E5E7EB.

Margin: 24pt top and bottom.

3. Action Section
Position: Below the form fields and divider, fixed to the bottom if the form is long, or static if short.

Content:

"Submit" Button:

Style: Full-width, solid button.

Height: 50pt

Background Color: Primary Color (e.g., Forest Green #0A7A4B).

Corner Radius: 8pt

Positioning: It should have a margin of 16pt from the sides and 24pt from the bottom (or bottom safe area).

Additional Design Details & Requirements
Interaction & Feedback States:

Input Field Focus State: When a user taps on a field, the border should change to the Primary Color (e.g., #0A7A4B) and thicken to 2pt.

Input Field Error State: (For future validation) Border color changes to Red (#EF4444), and a red error message appears below the field in 12pt text.

Button States:

Default: As described.

Pressed: Background color darkens by 15% (e.g., #06603E).

Disabled: Background color changes to #D1D5DB and text color to #9CA3AF. This state is used before all required fields are valid.

Spacing:

The vertical gap between each form field group (Label + Input) should be 24pt.

Keyboard Considerations:

The "Phone" field should trigger a numeric keypad.

The "Email" field should trigger an email-optimized keyboard (with '@' and '.').

Accessibility:

All interactive elements must have a minimum touch target of 44x44pt.

Ensure all text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background.

Form labels should be programmatically associated with their input fields for screen readers.
